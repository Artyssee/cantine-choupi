# This is the setup and explanation file for the cantine Choupi webshop

## Installation

Follow these instructions for the installation of the project

1. Go to the repository for cantine-choupi. Clone the repository locally in your preferred direcory.
2. Open your project in your code editor
3. run `npm ci` to install the necessary modules
4. (optional) go to insomnia or another API client and import the data from the executables/insomnia folder
5. run `npm run dev` to start developing

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm run stylelintc`

Runs the .stylelintrc rules through all the styling of the project. You are required to fix the styling before you can run the project.

### `npm run jsdoc`

Generates JSDoc documentation for the developer. You are required to document your code with JSDoc so that future developers can always understand your code.

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

If you have styling errors this script wil not run and you will be forced to fix the issues. JavaScript will always run regardless of the issues because this makes debugging easier. You are still required to fix them before you merge the branch into develop.

### `npm run build`

Builds a production version of the app. See `npm start` to run the prodcution version

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
